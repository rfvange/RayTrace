RayTrace
========

Ray trace application developed in Visual Studio 2010 Express using DirectX.

The code is based on "Advanced Graphics Programming in C and C++" by Roger T. Stevens and Christopher D. Watkins.
This exercise was based on my desire to learn DirectX graphics programming and solidify my usage of Visual Studio.

The weakest adaptation is the old VGA code to Windows. That still needs work. The rendered colors are pretty bad.

Sadly, I have neglected this code because of my immersion is Coursera courses. I have come a long way in other areas:
Machine Learning, Algorithms Theory and Applications, Data Analysis with R and Python, Functional Programming in Lisp
and Scala, Digital Signal Processing, programming in Matlab, etc.
